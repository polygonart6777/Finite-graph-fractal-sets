# Finite-graph-fractal-sets
This repository contains python code for creating fractal sets from labellings on a finite directed graph.
We use the tribonacci graph with the following labelling on the edges.

A user can decide on a labelling (a,b,c) where a,b,c are real numbers, to each of the edges of the graph and the code will output a set in the xy-plane.  

Here are a few examples of the sets that the code produces.
